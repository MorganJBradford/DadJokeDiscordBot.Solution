## üåê About the Project

### üìñ Description
A Discord bot that acts as a dad joke supplement to replace one of our retired instructors at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/). Written in C#/.NET, it utilizes an API via RESTful principles, WebSocket protocol, and Docker containerization for remote server hosting. 
<br>
<br>
Although no setup is required to simply invite the bot to your Discord server, if you would like to download, alter, or deploy the source code yourself, follow along with the instructions detailed in the [Getting Started](#-getting-started) Section.
<br>
<br> 
Otherwise, skip to the [Add OUR Bot](#%EF%B8%8F-add-our-bot) section to get started by adding the bot directly to your own Discord server.

      * Enter `dotnet restore` in your terminal.
      * Enter `dotnet run` in your terminal.

  #### Deploy via Docker

  1) Install the Docker app if you haven't already, and create an account.
  2) Create a new repository.
  3) In the DadJokeDiscordBot.Solution/Bot repository, run `docker build -t <your-app-name> .`
      * Run `docker build -t <your_username>/<your_repo_name> . ` to build your Docker image.
      * Run `docker run <your_username>/<your_repo_name>` to test your Docker image locally.
      * Run `docker push <your_username>/<your_repo_name>` to push your Docker image to Docker Hub.
